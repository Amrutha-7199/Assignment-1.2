Student Performance Data Analysis:

Project Overview:
This project analyzes a dataset on student performance to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships between various factors such as gender, parental education, ethnicity, lunch type, and test preparation course. The project provides insights into how these factors influence students' scores in math, reading, and writing.


Dataset:

The dataset consists of 1000 student records and the following attributes:
- gender: Gender of the student (male/female)
- race/ethnicity: The student's race/ethnicity group
- parental level of education: The highest level of education achieved by the student's parents
- lunch: Type of lunch the student receives (standard/free or reduced)
- test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (completed/none)
- math score: The student's score in mathematics
- reading score: The student's score in reading
- writing score: The student's score in writing



Visualizations:

The following visualizations were generated to analyze and interpret the dataset:
1.Distribution of Math Scores by Gender:
Purpose: Compare the distribution of math scores between male and female students.
Insight: Highlights gender-based performance trends and identifies any disparities in math scores.

2.Average Scores by Parental Level of Education
Purpose: Show how the education level of a student’s parents affects their academic performance.
Insight: Reveals correlations between higher parental education levels and student performance across subjects.

3.Effect of Test Preparation Course on Math Scores
Purpose: Examine the impact of completing a test preparation course on math scores.
Insight: Displays whether students who completed the course tend to score higher, helping assess the course’s effectiveness.

4.Correlation Heatmap of Scores
Purpose: Visualize the correlation between math, reading, and writing scores.
Insight: Identifies strong or weak relationships between scores in different subjects, useful for understanding subject interdependence.

5.Average Scores by Ethnicity Group
Purpose: Compare the average scores of students from different ethnic backgrounds.
Insight: Highlights disparities or trends in performance across different ethnic groups, which is useful for identifying areas needing attention.

6.Gender Comparison of Test Preparation Course Completion
Purpose: Show the distribution of students who completed the test preparation course based on gender.
Insight: Provides insights into gender-based participation in test preparation courses, which may influence score disparities.



Tools Used:
- Python
  - Libraries:
    - Pandas for data manipulation and processing.
    - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.


Conclusion:
The visualizations and analysis offer meaningful insights into the various factors affecting student performance. By leveraging these visual tools, stakeholders can make informed decisions to address disparities and improve educational outcomes.
